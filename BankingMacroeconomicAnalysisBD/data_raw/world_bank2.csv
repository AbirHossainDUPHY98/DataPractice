This indicator denotes the percentage change over each previous year of the constant price (base year 2015) series in United States dollars.","International Financial Statistics database, International Monetary Fund (IMF)",Financial Sector: Exchange rates & prices,WB_WDI,%,Annual,1960-2024,Median,"Methodology: Consumer Prices Indices are compiled in accordance with international standards: Consumer Price Index Manual, 2020 or 2004 version.

Statistical concept(s): The conceptual basis of a consumer price index series is to measure the rate at which prices of consumption goods and services are changing from one period to another.","A general and continuing increase in an economy’s price level is called inflation. The increase in the average prices of goods and services in the economy should be distinguished from a change in the relative prices of individual goods and services. Generally accompanying an overall increase in the price level is a change in the structure of relative prices, but it is only the average increase, not the relative price changes, that constitutes inflation. A commonly used measure of inflation is the consumer price index, which measures the prices of a representative basket of goods and services purchased by a typical household. The consumer price index is usually calculated on the basis of periodic surveys of consumer prices. Other price indices are derived implicitly from indexes of current and constant price series.",,,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

FB.AST.NPER.ZS,CC BY-4.0,Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans (%),"The indicator measures the proportion of a deposit taker’s loan portfolio that is impaired or at risk of default. It is calculated as the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total gross loans, where NPLs are defined as loans that are past due by 90 days or more or are otherwise considered unlikely to be repaid in full without the realization of collateral. Both non-performing loans and total gross loans should be reported at their gross book value, without deducting for loan-loss provisions or collateral. This indicator provides a key measure of asset quality and potential credit risk in the banking system.","Financial Soundness Indicators, International Monetary Fund (IMF), uri: https://data.imf.org/en/datasets/IMF:EXTERNAL_DATASET_CARDS/IMF.STA:LFSI",Financial Sector: Assets,WB_WDI,Percentage,Annual,2000-2023,Ratio of non-performing/total loan portfolio,"Methodology: The ratio is calculated by dividing the value of non-performing loans (NPLs) by the total value of gross loans, expressed as a percentage. Both NPLs and total gross loans should be reported at their gross book value, meaning before any deductions for provisions, write-offs, or collateral. Gross loans include all outstanding loans on the balance sheet, including those classified as non-performing. The classification of NPLs should be based on either quantitative criteria (e.g., days past due) or qualitative assessments (e.g., evidence of financial difficulties), following supervisory standards aligned with Basel guidance. Data should be compiled using a consistent consolidation basis, typically the cross-border, cross-sector, domestically incorporated consolidation approach (CBCSDI), to ensure comparability across reporting entities and jurisdictions. 
Statistical concept(s): The Non-performing Loans (NPLs) to Total Gross Loans ratio is a core indicator of asset quality within the banking sector. It measures the proportion of a deposit taker’s loan portfolio that is impaired or at significant risk of default. A loan is classified as non-performing when payments of principal or interest are overdue by 90 days or more, or when it is assessed that full repayment is unlikely without the realization of collateral, even if the loan is not yet past due. Data are submitted by national authorities to the IMF following the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) Compilation Guide.","This indicator serves as a key measure of asset quality within the banking sector. A higher ratio indicates a greater share of impaired loans, which can signal deteriorating credit risk and financial health of lending institutions. Conversely, a lower ratio reflects better asset quality and lower credit risk. Importantly, total gross loans include the full book value of loans before provisioning and do not net out collateral or guarantees. This indicator helps assess potential vulnerabilities in a financial system, especially when tracked over time or compared across institutions and jurisdictions.","Reporting countries compile the data using different methodologies, which may also vary for different points in time for the same country. Users are advised to consult the accompanying metadata on the IMF FSI website (data.imf.org) to conduct more meaningful cross-country comparisons or to assess the evolution of the indicator for any of the countries.",,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

Statistical concept(s): The conceptual elements of the SNA (System of National Accounts) measure what takes place in the economy, between which agents, and for what purpose. At the heart of the SNA is the production of goods and services. These may be used for consumption in the period to which the accounts relate or may be accumulated for use in a later period. In simple terms, the amount of value added generated by production represents GDP. The income corresponding to GDP is distributed to the various agents or groups of agents as income and it is the process of distributing and redistributing income that allows one agent to consume the goods and services produced by another agent or to acquire goods and services for later consumption. The way in which the SNA captures this pattern of economic flows is to identify the activities concerned by recognizing the institutional units in the economy and by specifying the structure of accounts capturing the transactions relevant to one stage or another of the process by which goods and services are produced and ultimately consumed.","This indicator is related to the national accounts, which are critical for understanding and managing a country's economy. They provide a framework for the analysis of economic performance. National accounts are the basis for estimating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI), which are the most widely used indicator of economic performance. They are essential for government policymakers, providing the data needed to design and assess fiscal and monetary policies; and are also used by businesses and investors to assess the economic climate and make investment decisions. NAS enable comparison between economies, which is crucial for international trade, investment decisions, and economic competitiveness. More specifically, this indicator is related to national accounts aggregates. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Income (GNI), and other aggregates provide a snapshot of the size and health of an economy by measuring the total economic activity within a country. They can thus be used by policymakers to design and implement economic policies, as they reflect the overall economic performance and can indicate the need for intervention in certain areas. Aggregates also allow for comparisons between different economies, which can be useful for trade negotiations, investment decisions, and economic benchmarking. By examining aggregates over time, economists and analysts can identify trends, cycles, and potential areas of concern within an economy, and investors can use national accounts aggregates to assess the potential risks and returns of investing in a particular country. Overall, national accounts aggregates are fundamental tools for economic analysis, policy formulation, and decision-making at both the national and international levels.",,,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
